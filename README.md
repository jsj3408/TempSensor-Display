# BMP280 Temperature Sensor Integrated to SSD1306 OLED screen using FRDM-KL25

## Overview
This is a simple baremetal project where an MCU (FRDM-KL25 dev board) is used to communicate to a temperature sensor (BMP280) and then displays this data to an OLED display. Communication is done via I2C and power supply given from a PC.
This was purely a hobbyist project. I had undertaken this for the below reasons:
- simply to learn I2C communication between peripherals.
- develop the skill to read (swim) through a datasheet and seek out for the necessary info.
- understand how to use better the FRDM-KL25 MCU.

That being said, the API's that I had made over NXP's communication might be of some use to the community, hence I am pushing this project here. I'm happy also to receive feedback on the same. The code is pretty rustic, but I've tried to make the API's as modular/abstract as possible.

Development IDE : MCUXpresso
Programming Language : C

Also credits to (Eran Duchan)[http://www.eran.io/the-dot-factory-an-lcd-font-and-image-generator/] for his awesome code generator to output the bitmaps of Calibri 7pt that I use on my display.
